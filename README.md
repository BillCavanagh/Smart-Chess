# Project intended to function as a chess game with a Javafx GUI
# Note: This project is not my main focus right now, I am mostly learning html/css/javascript and brushing up on python. It is not my main focus due to that and it is mostly complete and just needs refactoring/debugging/prettying up the GUI; at least for now.
