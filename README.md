# Project intended to function as a chess game with a Javafx GUI
# Note: This project is not my main focus right now, I am mostly learning html/css/javascript and college. This project is mostly complete and needs refactoring/debugging/prettying up the GUI; at least for now. I have plans to add more features to this program
