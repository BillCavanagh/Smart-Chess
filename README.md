# Project intended to function as a chess game with a Javafx GUI
# Note: This project is mostly complete and needs refactoring/debugging/prettying up the GUI as well as unit tests; at least for now. I have plans to add more features to this program such as a simple chess bot, move suggestions, and a board editor later on (I would like to learn more about other languages).
