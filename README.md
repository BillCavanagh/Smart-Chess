# Project intended to function as a chess game with a Javafx GUI
# Note: This project is not my main focus right now, I am mostly learning html/css/javascript and brushing up on Python. It is not my main focus due to that and it being mostly complete and just needs refactoring/debugging/prettying up the GUI
